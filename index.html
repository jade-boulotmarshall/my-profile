  		<h2>My Passion in Life</h2>
  	</div>
  	<div class="white-card">
     <h3>Culture</h3>
     <p> I am someone very attracted to new cultures. I have been facing other cultures from the day I was born (having parents from two different countries), which I believe, made me as open-minded as I am today. I love to discover new ways of thinking, living, being. I have travelled a lot, but I am nowhere near done with it, I am actually even more eager to travel more in the future. I strongly appreciate the differences in each individual, and going abroad is something very nourishing to me. I love to learn about other countries, languages and customs.</p>

  	<div class="white-card">
  	 <h3>Cinema</h3>
     <p> I've always been into cinematography, as my father was once a camera man. I spent a whole week in a french limited company specialized in digital technologies for the film and audiovisual industry, and I loved it. I love discovering how everything works behind the screen, whether it be during the filming or the postproduction of a movie or tv show. I try to watch as many movies as possible to expand my film culture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="white-card"> 
     <h3>Skincare/Selfcare</h3>
     <p>I started to be interested in skincare and selfcare in general when I was in middle school. I found a japanese book talking about "japanese beauty secrets" which led me to discover the world of selfcare and beauty, and the country itself. Since then, I have been very aware of what I buy for myself, and I have developed a real passion for the science behind skincare. </p>
